        Greece is a famous country, popular for its clean beaches and its long history. There are hundreds of archaeological and historical sites to visit in Greece that gloriously depict the country's past.

        When is the Time Right?
    </div>
    <p>
        The autumn and spring are the best time to visit Greece when neither the temperature nor the crowds are too overwhelming. However, those looking to party on the islands should consider a July or August vacation – the most popular time of year to visit and also the most fun. Some of the tourist attractions go on hiatus during the winter months, so traveling between November and March isn’t advised for culture seekers.
